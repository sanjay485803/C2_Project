<!-- summary of proj -->
## Project Overview

"CHATCODER’S HAVEN” aims to develop a feature-rich web application for online coding, providing users with a multilingual compiler supporting Python, Java, and C++. The platform offers an intuitive coding environment with syntax highlighting tailored to each programming language, along with auto-closing brackets for tags and line numbering displayed on the left side of each line. Users can also enjoy a dark theme option for enhanced visibility and reduced eye strain.

An integrated Chatbot enhances user experience by providing real-time support. Leveraging the MERN stack, the project prioritizes flexibility and scalability for future expansion and integration of new features. While the current iteration offers Python, Java, and C++ programming languages, the project envisions future expansion to incorporate additional languages and functionalities akin to Visual Studio Code (VS Code in Online).

By providing a user-friendly interface, syntax highlighting tailored to each language, and real-time collaboration, we empower coders worldwide. Our project bridges the gap between coding proficiency and accessibility, fostering a vibrant community of learners and creators.

This project is developed and maintained by Group 78 members of Capstone Project 108 at I.I.T Patna.
